  <!-- Required, the absolute path to the bin directory of your
    BLAST application. If the path points to the bin directory, it should
    end with a '/'; if the points to a script, for example, if you are
    using the new NCBI BLAST+ with old parameter format, the path should
    include "<....>/bin/legacy_blast.pl " in the end. Note that in this
    case, the empty space at the end is needed. -->

    control the default blastdb location for wu-blast.

     group, and capture group index can be specified by SourceIdRegexIndex
